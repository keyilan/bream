A standalone single-file (other than images) modern beamer theme for LaTeX

## Introduction

I like beamer, and I like [metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), but it's really one of the few good themes out there.

This is an ongoing project to create a single theme that suits all of my own needs, while being entirely transparent in terms of functions and customisation. It's surely bad practice to have everything in one (maybe at some point two) files, but this way there are no surprises from some other modified theme.

## Features

It's super basic.
