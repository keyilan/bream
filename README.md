A standalone three-file (minus images) modern beamer theme for LaTeX.

## Introduction

I like beamer, and I like [metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), but it's really one of the few good themes out there.

This is an ongoing project to create an easily modifiable theme that suits all of my own needs, while being entirely transparent in terms of functions and customisation. It's surely bad practice to have everything in one or two files, but this way there are no surprises arising from improperly modifying an existing theme.

**Note:** No actual themes are defined in terms of these files. All formatting is contained within the preamble, separated from the slide content in order to prevent accidents when creating new presentations.

## Features

It's super basic.

## Files

`preamble.tex` – Everything but the slide contents. All formatting is declared here.

`presentation.tex` – The contents of the presentations

`refrences.bib`

## Licence & Modifications

These files are distributed as-is. You are free to make modifications to suit your needs.
